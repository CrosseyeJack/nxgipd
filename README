nxgipd v1.0.0beta
=================

nxgipd is a monitoring daemon for UTC / GE Interlogix / Caddx alarm systems
that use the Networx NX-584 protocol.

Daemon process requires very minimal memory and cpu resource making it suitable
to be run in on almost any hardware that runs Linux (or feel free to port 
this to your favorite OS :-)
nxgipd daemon process is meant to continuously monitor the alarm panel and
log any activity into local log file and/or to syslog.
Command line tools nxstat and nxcmd allow real-time polling of the alarm
status and interact with the alarm.

NOTE! Before you can use this program you typically need to first install 
NX-584E (home automation) module or enable built-in serial port (NX-8E panel).
If you don't know the program code (PIN) for your panel, you may need to get
your alarm provider to do this for you.


SUPPORTED ALARM PANEL MODELS

	NX-8 
	NX-8V2
	NX-8E 

	(other panels that use same "Networx NX-584 RS-232 Gateway
	 Interface Protocol" might work fine as well...)

	Mini-XML library (libmxml) v2.6 or later version

INSTALLATION
	Installation should be very straightforward, just unpack the
	tar file, run configure,  make necessary changes to the Makefile,

		tar xzvf nxgipd-1.0.0.tar.gz
		cd nxgipd-1.0.0
		./configure
		make

	Then copy included nxgipd.conf template to /etc/nxgipd.conf and update
        it to match your setup.


SERIAL INTERFACE CONFIGURATION

       For this program to work, the NX-584 interface module (or the built-in
